# Self Governance in Cities

It is defined in the constitution that Gram sabha is the common assembly of people living in a village.  In spite of the fact that constitution recognizes the gram sabha yet the sabha has been vested with no power. Under self governance we believe that Government funds, government servants, government laws, actions that go towards making laws and natural resources should come under the control of people through the gram sabhas. Unfortunately any social set up of people living in the cities has no constitutional recognition or legal legitimacy. For this separate law will have to be drafted.

#### Experiment in Delhi

This is true that Resident welfare Associations (RWA) has not been legally recognized but at many a places people have taken initiative and formed associations. It would be worthwhile to high light the initiative in Delhi. For a long time in certain areas of East Delhi, under the initiation of Swaraj movement, local assemblies are being organized. The people are taking decisions in local matters of the government. Government officials and political leaders are getting those works implemented. This commendable work is being carried out in Trilokpuri and Sundarnagri ward of NDMC. Each ward has been divided in ten localities. Each locality meets once in one or two months.

In these assemblies of people, under the aegis of self governance movement, officials of Municipal Corporations and representative of people join hands in the proceedings. How and where the money of corporation is to be spent is decided by the assembly of the people. Before this all these decisions were taken by few government officers and political leaders in "closed rooms".  But today the situation is such that any member of the assembly can raise his voice against problems related to water, electricity, roads, etc. His demand is noted by the government officers and councilors, present in the meeting, who get the funds released for the same. In case the list of demands is long and adequate funds are not available then in the same meetings the priority of works is decided by the votes of the people, on the basis of which the work would be carried out.

The councilors of Sundarnagari and Trilokpuri have already announced that the payment against the work carried out in their area would be made to the contractors only when local body expresses its satisfaction with the quality of work. This decision has improved the quality of work carried out in their areas.    There  are  various  social  welfare  schemes  like  pension  for  the  old,  physically  challenged individuals and pension for widows. List for such residents is made in an open assembly. People are transparent and discuss among themselves as to who is the poorest and who should get benefit of these schemes first. Earlier this benefit used to accrue to near dears of the councilors. The governor of Delhi has congratulated the councilors who were conducting these types of meetings. He directed the local police officers to be present in such meetings. He also directed the commissioner of corporation to conduct such meetings in all areas of Delhi.

#### Steps by the Central Government

There is a wide spread demand in Delhi for giving legal recognition to residents welfare associations. A draft of  "Model Nagar Raj Bill" has been sent to all state governments by the central government last year in which it was requested that they should make necessary amendments, using their intellectual discretion, and pass the bill in their Vidhan Sabhas. This step is a big event of the central government. This is for the first time that resident welfare associations are being recognized as a unit of a city. But the sad part is that in draft of the central government, RWA have not been vested with real power.

Civil society members have rejected the current draft of Local government bill. Many prominent citizens like Mr. Prashant Bhushan, Lawyer of Supreme Court, Social worker Mr. Anna Hazare, Former Chief Secretary Mr. S. C. Bahar, have come up with a new draft for the Local government bill. Let us look at the prominent provisions of the "Local government bill" which is being demanded by the members of the civil society.

##### Salient Provisions of the proposed Law

a. Three thousand individuals (Voters) living in a specific locality of a city should be allowed to form an association.

d. Residents of villages existing in metropolis like Delhi must have the right of their own land.

##### Control over Municipal Corporation

We as tax payers have the right to spend our money on our own welfare.

Any RWA can forward a proposal to Municipal Corporation, for consideration or implementation of any issue related to the RWA, provided two-third of the members has voted for the same. It would be mandatory for the municipal corporation to consider such a proposal forwarded by the RWA. This proposal could be for building roads or for a park or repair of walkways or for a community centre. As long as majority vote ratifies the proposal there is nothing unconstitutional in such a proposal.

The government is spending our money indiscriminately without keeping our needs in perspective. We are demanding a change, in which we now tell the government what we want.

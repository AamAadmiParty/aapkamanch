# Law Needed for Self Governance of Villages

For people to take decisions under the aegis of gram sabhas following changes will have to be brought about in our legislation so that people will have control over their fate and their lives. They would then be responsible for their own progress.

#### Gram Sabhas should be supreme

The Problem: In the present system gram sabhas have been given very little power and the power that is given vests with the sarpanch or head of the panchayat. This association of people on village level has no control over the actions of sarpanch. In most of the laws enacted for gram sabhas, their role is limited to giving advice to the sarpanch. The sarpanch has the option of accepting or rejecting the advice. Therefore, people suck up to the sarpanch. This makes the sarpanch autocratic and corrupt. The people of gram sabha, in absence of any power to question his actions, stand by as helpless spectators. Since they are unable to take any action, the people of gram sabhas have distanced themselves from the day to day working of the gram sabhas.

Law has not given any power to the people of gram Sabha to make amends if the sarpanch is taking wrong decisions or is indulging in corrupt practices. The district administrator however, has the right to take action against the sarpanch. Each district administrator has about one thousand village panchayats under him. District administrator is located in a city far away from villages. He has no clue to the functioning of sarpanch of a panchayat. When villagers make complaint against the sarpanch then in most cases no action is initiated against the sarpanch because the district administrator has no time for them. If the Sarpanch belongs to the ruling party or has affiliation with the local M.P., MLA or a leader then the administrator under their influence does not bother to initiate any inquiry. In this way no action is taken against the erring sarpanch.

Since there are more than thousand villages under the administrator, he assigns the work of supervising the sarpanch to the block development officers (BDO) or some junior officials. These officials in turn indulge in extorting money from the sarpanch. If a sarpanch, who is honest, refuses to pay then the BDO's and junior officers initiate inquiries of false cases against the sarpanch. The BDO's and junior officials with the power vested in them to take action against the sarpanch, coerce the sarpanch to toe their line and make him part of the corrupt practices. This happens in connivance with the district collector who, either on his own volition or under the pressure of political masters blesses the actions of his junior officers. This platform of coercion is both used for siphoning off the government funds and to spread political influence of a party. "Do as directed" or an action will be taken against you becomes the rule for the sarpanch of a village.

Suggestion: The first step is to free this sarpanch from the clutches of the district administrator and make him accountable to the people directly. Our suggestions are as follows.

a. The gram Sabha should be given the power to take all decisions. Their decisions should be final and the role of sarpanch should be limited to implementing the decisions.

b. If a sarpanch is found to be indulging in embezzling funds or in criminal acts or in corrupt practices then the gram Sabha should have power to direct the police to register a first Information report (FIR) against the accused sarpanch. The progress report of the action taken against the sarpacnh should be placed before the gram Sabha on regular basis.

c. Unless, the gram Sabha specifically requests for an action against the sarpanch, the district administrator or any other officer should have no power to take any action against a sarpanch.

d. In case a sarpanch does not follow the wishes of the gram Sabha then gram Sabha should have the power to recall this sarpanch. If more than fifty percent people pass a vote of "No confidence" against the sarpanch and send it over to the election commission then the commission should verify the signatures within fifteen days. Within thirty days of verification of signatures a secret ballot should take place against the impeachment? If "No confidence" vote is won with majority then that sarpanch should be removed from his post and a new sarpanch should be installed with fresh mandate of the people.

Recall of sarpanch is a sure shot formula that should be used as a last resort. There are several states where this right to recall has been bestowed on people of gram sabhas. Many villages in these states have used this power. Unfortunately there are no remedies for an in between situations. Either you have a sarpanch or you recall him. There are no provisions, where the people could direct him time to time and force him to take corrective actions. As soon as the process of removing a sarpanch starts, the wheels of local politics come into motion. This local politics is then supported by the realignment of politics on the state level that leads to a lot of undesirable corrupt practices. Because of this an honest debate becomes impossible on the proposed "No confidence motion".

We believe, if the gram sabhas get all kinds of power to take decisions of amendment, advice with which they could direct the sarpanch from time to time. Then it would not become necessary to remove the sarpanch. In such a case he will be an equal partner in the joint process of taking a decision at every stage. It is believed that there will be no need to use ultimate weapon "Recall".

#### Projects on Village level should be under villages

Problem: In today's establishment there is confusion on the jurisdiction of works, resources and organization.

Suggestion: In earlier part of the book it was mentioned that lists should be created of all the works, resources and organizations under whose jurisdiction they fall. After this these assets should be transferred under the jurisdiction of respective village or block or the district level of administration. The funds required to operate and maintain or execute works along with the government officials should also be allocated to that level only.

#### Control over Government employees

Problem: People have no control over the acts of omission and commission by the government employees and find themselves in a helpless situation.

Suggestion:

a. The control over the government employees, both administrative and operational, connected with execution of works, maintenance of properties and their organizations should be passed on to various levels of panchayats. The employees should be considered as employees of the panchayat under which they have been transferred. When employed employees retire then the new  appointment  should  be  made  by the  panchayat  under  which the vacancies  fall.  State government should play no role in new appointments.

b. On all levels panchayats should have the powers to appoint new employees to fulfill its needs.
These employees should be treated as employees of the panchayat and not employees of the state government.

c. The panchayats should have complete administrative control over the employees irrespective of the  fact that  they  were  transferred  from  elsewhere  or  were  appointed  by  the  panchayat directly. Gram Sabha should have power to charge sheet an employee, also be able to punish an erring employee and suspend him, if the need arises.

d. Gram sabhas should have power to cancel the license of an essential commodity dealer like,
kerosene or ration or gas, if found engaging in malpractices and appoint a new dealer.

e. All gram sabhas should be empowered to issue directive to any government employee and if need arises then send him a summon asking him to be present in the meetings of the sabhas. If the directive of a gram sabha is not in conflict with the directive of a different gram Sabha then it should be mandatory for the concerned employee to obey the directives issued by the gram Sabha. (Note: Sometimes an employee is on the block level and responsible for looking after works related to a block instead of a village). In case of conflict, it should be resolved on that level of the panchayat. In case an employee ignores a summon sent by a gram sabha or defies the orders issued by it, then the gram Sabha should be empowered to reprimand the employee and impose a fine on him, too.

#### Control over government funds:

Problem: The Central and state governments conceive many illogical plans and projects that have nothing to do with primary needs of the people. These plans are conduits for siphoning off the money, increase corruption and have no relevance to the needs of the people. They are digressive in nature and encourage people to sloth and laziness. This has been discussed earlier in the book.

Suggestion: In our opinion all these grandiose schemes should be abandoned herewith. Most of the funds that are made available to the panchayats should not be tied to any scheme. The fund should be a free fund available at the disposal of the gram Sabha, to be disposed off in a fashion that the gram Sabha desires.

The state government of Kerala transfers 40 % of its annual budget fund directly to gram sabhas. The need of the day is that at least 50% of the annual budget of all the states, should be sanctioned and distributed to the gram sabhas as free fund. There should be no caveat attached with the fund and gram sabhas should be free to use this fund for development in a way they think is best for them.

For release of fund, in today's time, panchayats face problem and many a times are forced to pay bribes to senior officers of the government. On first April of every year money is transferred in the accounts at various levels of panchayat in Kerala. This is how the funds should be transferred every year to all panchayats, thereby, removing all difficulties faced by the gram sabhas in getting the fund.

If a group, belonging to backward section of society in a particular village, puts up a demand then a part of the fund from the main fund of the gram Sabha should be sanctioned to that group for their needs. This will ensure that muscle men of the village do not have undue power over the backward classes.

#### Control over Block and district panchayats

Problem: In the present system gram sabhas work under the middle level and district levels of panchayats. The proposals of gram panchayats are approved by the middle level panchayats. Mostly the payment of works carried out on the village panchayat levels are made by the middle and district level panchayats. However, there is no control of gram sabhas over the working of the middle and district levels of gram panchayats.

Suggestion:

a. The proposals made and decisions taken by the gram sabhas, for their village, should be final.
The gram sabhas do not have to take approval from anyone on financial or administrative or any other matter.

b. The government will have to take permission to start a scheme from each of the gram sabhas that are affected by it. Also any gram Sabha can give suggestion to start a new scheme to its block or district panchayat. In general a plan should be implemented by the government only when it has been approved by all the affected gram sabhas in that area.

c. Role of Sarpanch of a village is merely to act like a bridge between gram Sabha and the block panchayat. Before making any commitment to the district panchayat the sarpanch will have to consult and take permission from the gram Sabha. In the same way the block sarpanch is a bridge between block panchayat and the district panchayat. He too will have to take the permission from the affected block panchayats before making any commitment to the district panchayat.  Gram  sabha,  if  so  desires,  can  give  the  option  to the sarpanch  of  not  taking permission from the gram sabha on certain matters. This option should be to a limited extent only.

#### Direct control over policy formation and state assemblies

Problem: We are a democracy In India. Although we elect our representatives but we have no control over the representative between two successive elections spread over a period of five years. We have no control over the formulation of laws enacted by the state and central governments. It is being observed that in last many years the government is enacting such laws that are detrimental to the welfare of its citizens. Many laws are enacted to benefit both national and international business houses under the pressure of foreign governments. There is a need to put an effective control over it.

Suggestions: The people should have certain control over the process of formulating laws in the parliament. This control could be given in two ways.

##### a. The role of citizens in enactment of new policies and laws:

If more than five percent of the gram sabhas moot a proposal to formulate a policy then the state government should forward the proposal to all gram sabhas. If more than fifty percent of the gram sabhas endorse the proposal then it is obligatory on the part of the state governments to enact the proposal into a law or a policy. In the same way the gram sabhas should have the power to partly or wholly reject or amend a law or a policy. They should also have the power to amend or cancel a scheme of the government.

This way the citizens will initiate a new chapter in the process of reforms. These could be reforms  in  the police  department  or  reforms  related  to  judicial  system,  or  enactment  of powerful laws against corruption. This will usher in a new era of citizens participation in the government functioning.

##### b. The opinion of the citizens in tabled proposals for formulating all laws and policies in the state
assemblies and the parliament.

As per the constitution, elected representative are the installed members in parliament and the legislative assemblies of states. In the same way block and district panchayat officials are the members of the panchayat. As per law they have not been given any work.

A  law  should  be  enacted that  a  copy  of all  the  proposals  and bills  that  are  tabled in the parliament (besides the finance bill and no confidence motion)  be brought to the district or block panchayat and distribute the same to the representatives of all gram sabhas and resident welfare associations in the cities.

These laws or bills then should be discussed and dissected in the  gram sabhas and the  resident welfare associations in the cities. Only after receiving a consensus opinion they should put them up in the parliament for voting.

#### Right to information by the gram sabhas

Problem: There are many a decisions that are taken by the state and central governments that affect directly the lives of its citizens.

Suggestions: Gram sabhas must get the right to seek information, from any of the government officials of the state that directly or indirectly affects his village. If the official fails to give the information then gram Sabha should have the power to imposed a fine of rupees twenty five thousand on this erring official.

#### Control over the panchayat secretary

Problem: The secretary of the panchayat is appointed by the state government. He in collusion with sarpanch and other officials fosters corruption. He is not at all accountable to the people and therefore, the people have no control over him.

Suggestion: The appointment of panchayat secretary should be done by the gram sabha. His role should be limited to implementing the decisions of the gram Sabha. Gram sabhas should have complete control over him, which includes power to punish the secretary, stop his salary and if the need be power to suspend him from the post.

#### Issues of corruption in panchayats:

Problem: Corruption  has  seeped  into  all  government  works.  Payments  are  made  not  only  for  works of extremely cheap quality but also for non existing works which are only shown on papers. When the citizens make complaint no action is taken. There are two reasons behind this.

a. Whenever a government work takes place, the verification of the work is carried out by a government official that the work has been carried out as per specification and, therefore, the payment should be released. The citizens or the gram sabhas are not involved in this process of verification. In Uttar Pradesh the SDM verifies that a canal has been cleaned properly. Many a times he just accepts a bribe and gives a verification certificate in spite of the fact that the cleaning has not even taken place. No body bothers to ask the farmers who use the canal water if the same is cleaned or not.

b. When  complaint  is  lodged  against  these  officials  with  their  senior  officer,  the  inquiry  is
conducted by the officers of vigilance department. Under political pressure, or by accepting bribes or just because of carelessness they do not take any action. The citizens on the other hand have no control over these vigilance officers.

Suggestions: In our view on the above mentioned issues the gram sabha should be given the following powers.

a. Unless  gram  sabha  has  given  a  certificate  of  satisfaction  of  the  executed  work  of  the government, no payment should be made to the contractor who has carried out the work. In case the work is of poor quality then the gram sabha should also have power to initiate an inquiry into the works. The tainted contractor should be black listed and orders should be passed to correct the deficiency in the works. If guilty officials, responsible for the work, are under the jurisdiction of the gram sabhas then gram sabhas should have power to take action against them.

b. If corruption is of criminal nature then gram sabha must be empowered to direct the police to
register an FIR and give regular reports on the progress of their inquiry.

#### Alcoholism in Villages

Problem: In present time license for opening a liquor shop is given by the government departments on the
recommendations  of  political  leaders.  They  normally  accept  bribes  for  giving  that  permission. Serious problems crop up because of liquor shops. Many families are destroyed by the habit of alcoholism. The irony is that no one takes the opinion of people whose lives are affected in the vicinity of the shop. The shop is thrust on them, whether they want it or not.

Suggestion: The license to open a shop should be given, only when the permission is granted by the gram sabha in whose jurisdiction the shop falls. This permission of gram Sabha must have the consent of 90% of the women of the gram Sabha. By a majority vote, the women of the gram Sabha also should have power to get the license of an existing shop cancelled.

#### License for Industry and mining

Problem: State and the central government issue license for Industry and mining. But people residing in the areas have to bear the brunt of its adverse effects. There is no role that these people play in the process of issue of license.

Suggestion: No permission should be granted for large industry set up and mining without the consent of the people of that area. The gram sabhas could grant the permission with certain conditions. In case these conditions are not met with, then the gram sabhas should have the power to cancel the permission, if given earlier.

#### Land acquisition

Problem:

a. Land is acquired by various state agencies from the people for various projects and Industry without considering the opinion of the affected people. Not only people loose their home and hearth but also face unemployment. The compensation paid in lieu of the land is inadequate. Even if the rates are paid as per the prevailing market prices, then also the people's problem are not lessened. We are merely taking an example that an acre of land is sufficient for a farmer to grow crop year after year and take care of his needs for a life time but rupee forty or fifty thousand that is paid as compensation is not sufficient to take care of his expenses for a life time. Such acquisition alleviates poverty.

b. Though the land owner gets an inadequate compensation but the labour who was working on that land does not get anything. He faces the specter of unemployment and poverty.

c. In many a places it has been observed that when the land was acquired, under duress, from the villagers then they joined the violent ranks of the naxals.

Suggestions: Gram sabhas should be empowered to take decision on suitability of a project whether it is for the welfare of the people of the area or not, whether the land should be given for the project or not. If it is decided the land should be given for the project then at what rate and conditions. There opinion of gram sabhas should be supreme. To give these power following provisions should be made in the laws.

a. If any company, central or state government is interested in acquiring land then it should send an application to the panchayat of the concerned village.

b. Original papers should be submitted, duly translated in the local language explaining how the acquired land will be used and what kind of project will be put up. The papers should be submitted to all gram Sabha panchayats that are affected to enable them evaluate various pros and cons of the acquisition.

c. Based on the information submitted to the panchayat a campaign should be organized in each village to make people aware of the land acquisition. If any person of the village wants a photocopy of the project then a photocopy should be made available to him after charging money for the same.

d. After giving papers to the village panchayats, each panchayat should call a meeting to discuss the project. If there are doubts and fears about the project then the gram panchayats would send in a request to the company, central or state government which is putting up the project to appoint their representative to give answers to their doubts and fears in the gram Sabha. If more information is needed then gram Sabha could request for the same.

e. In the next meeting, which would be attended by the representative of the acquiring agency, all doubts and fears would be put to discussions. No decision would be taken on acquisition, except question answer session in this meeting.

f. If the gram sabha is satisfied with documents furnished and the answers of the representative then gram sabha will call another meeting for taking the decision on the acquisition issue. In case it requires more information then  it  would  send  in  a  request  to  the  company,  state government or the central government.

g. The meeting in which the gram sabha takes the final decision, no outsider would be allowed like the company representative, state or central government representative and the police. Even the media would be kept at a distance from the meeting. This meeting would not be chaired by the gram sarpanch or the pradhan. The people of the gram sabha will choose, with consensus, a respectable person amongst themselves to head this meeting. The minutes of the meeting would not be written by the secretary of the gram sabha but by a person chosen from amongst the people present.

A vote would be taken to decide if the people want to give away the land or not. If yes then on what terms and conditions? The gram Sabha will ensure that interest of all concerned is taken care of while taking unanimous decision. This Sabha will take care of the interest of the landless and the labours who work on the land and the acquisition would result in their unemployment. If need be then more than one gram sabhas should conduct meetings jointly to reach a consensus.

h. Whatever is the decision taken by such a consensus would rein supreme. The government will
have no power to make amendments or reject the same.

i. There should be a national policy on rehabilitation of the land owners and landless which should clearly define their basic rights. If the gram Sabha gives consent to land acquisition then provisions laid down in the rehabilitation policy, without tempering the basic rights, would form the basis of acquisition. The gram sabhas on the other hand will be free to negotiate other terms and demand more. The decision of the gram Sabha will be treated as final.

j. The country is passing through a great food crisis. This crisis would deepen in the times to come.
It is important in the national interest to preserve fertile land for the purpose of agriculture only. The nation will survive without roads, power and industry but we will not be able to survive for a day without food. A law should be enacted that bans the use of land that yields two crops a year for  any  purpose  other  than  agriculture.  Such  land  should  be  identified  and  marked  for agriculture use only by the gram sabhas.

#### Land records

Problem: The land records are tempered by the local officials of the government on a large scale through
fraud. There are many cases of fraud and of collusion of these government officials who have transferred the land belonging to poor and helpless farmers in the name of someone else. Besides this, it is a gigantic task to ferret out information related to a property from the land revenue department. Getting work out of this department is even more difficult.

Suggestion: All the documents pertaining to land, under the supervision of gram sabhas, should be taken care off by the office of gram panchayat. The list of all property transfer should be promulgated by the gram sabhas on a monthly basis. Any inquiry made by an individual or a society must be answered within a stipulated time by the gram sabha. Failing to adhere to the time lines, the concerned officials of gram sabha should be fined suitably.


#### Control over natural resources

Problem: For centuries the local population was using limited natural resources for their needs and also
preserving  the  environment.  The  control  of  natural  resources  like  forest,  rivers  and  mines started from the time British established rule in the country. From that time the exploitation started of  these  natural  resources  while  the  local population was  displaced.  However,  the situation did not change after the independence. In last few years the process of exploitation of natural resources has increased where the land of the locals whose life depended on these was snatched from them. It has been mentioned earlier that the government is selling these natural resources to business houses and contractors at throw away prices.


Suggestion: The gram sabhas should be made the owner of all small water resources, forests, minerals that fall under the jurisdiction of the gram sabha. It should also be ensured that without the consent of the concerned gram sabhas no one is given the lease to use the water resources, forests, mines and land. The gram sabhas will decide who should be given the lease to use or not to use the natural resources and at what terms and conditions. If the terms and conditions of the contract of lease for the use of these resources are violated, in future by a contractor, then the gram sabhas should have the power to cancel the lease of such a contractor. If such violations have caused damage to environment or to group of people then the contracting company should be made to pay damages.

It has been mentioned earlier in the book that natural resources are the national property of the country. How that should be deployed for national and general welfare is a question that needs to be discussed on all levels of the gram Sabha to create a national policy. The gram sabhas then could use these policies as a basis to give permission for use of the natural resources in their areas.

#### Corruption in Government offices

Problem: Be it a passport office or an office of the municipality, revenue department or the office of the SDM the citizens face all kinds of problems and are forced to give bribes to get their work done. It could be driving license or a birth certificate, it could be a death certificate or verification of land records, it could be complaint for a blocked drain or an application for getting electrical power, a citizen is forced to pay bribes to the government officials.

Suggestion: Verification certificates for cast, income, residence proof etc should be issued by the panchayat office. In case if the panchayat secretary shows lack in his duty then he should be called to the gram Sabha for questioning. In any case the Gram Sabha has the power to reprimand and penalize the secretary for his acts of disobedience.

Passports, driving licenses, electricity and water connections should be given to citizens within a specified time after receiving an application. If time lines are not met then the concerned official should be fined suitably.

#### Collection of taxes

Problem: We use unscientific methods to collect and spend the taxes. Most of the taxes are collected by
the state and central governments. These taxes are used through various plans and schemes of the government for the states, towns and villages. The money gets siphoned on two levels.

One at the level when it is being collected that is on the upwards journey to the government treasury and then when the money is spent that is on its downward journey.  What is surprising that the collected taxes on the local levels are not spent on the local level? The people are totally ignorant as to where collected taxes have been used?

Suggestion: Experience suggests that if people are made to participate in the process of collection of taxes and if they know how these taxes will be used for their benefit then collection of taxes will become much easier.

As far as is possible the services of the gram sabhhas should be taken for collection of various
types of taxes. Gram sabha is primary unit of the conglomeration of people for whom the taxes would be used for collective benefit. There can be no agency, government or otherwise, better than the gram Sabha itself to carry out this task. Our suggestions are as follows.

State governments should make list of various type of taxes:

a. List of those taxes that are imposed and collected by the state government.

b. Those taxes that would be imposed by the state government but the collection would be on the direction of gram panchayat.

c. Those  taxes  that  would  be  imposed  by  the  higher  levels  of  panchayats  but  would  be collected by lower levels of panchayats.

d. Those taxes that are imposed and collected by the same level of panchayats. An effort should be made that most of the taxes should fall in this category so that each level of panchayat could become financially independent.

e. Income generated out of the wealth of gram Sabha should be credited in the account of that gram sabhas only. Part of the duties imposed by the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee  (APMC)  at  the  market  place  should  also  be  credited  to  the  concerned panchayats. We would mention here that both buyer and seller have to pay taxes to the APMC. Where and how this tax is spent is not known to any body?

#### Consolidation of many villages under one panchayat

Problem: Presently many far flung villages are clubbed together under one panchayat. The people of the
village are not able to attend the meetings of the sabhas. These villages are different from each other on the basis of caste, creed, and religion, their economic and social differences. It has been seen that their problems and solutions are also different. Many villages have enmity that dates back to many generations. The villages are not connected with roads or railway that creates problems of commuting for attending the gram sabhas. Taking all the above issues under consideration their consolidation on one level is unworkable.

Suggestion: Irrespective of the size of the village, each village should be declared as a panchayat. If two or more villages want to consolidate under a single unit then they should be declared as a unit of panchayat. Under PESA such provisions are available for the backward classes. The same law should be extended to the entire country.

#### Consolidation of panchayat on block and district level:

Problem: In today's system the sarpanch of a village in lower levels of panchayat is a member of the
higher level of panchayat. Besides this election is conducted for members of block and district levels of panchayat. The past records of the working of the panchayat show that there is no improvement in the working methodology of the panchayat because of this. This methodology on the other hand has fueled corruption. Whenever, there is a proposal of 'No confidence motion' against the chairperson of the middle and district level of panchayat then the existing members start to bid their prices for their vote to support or reject the 'No confidence motion'. In many a cases the chairperson pays the members on a regular basis to remain in office. The Chairpersons of higher levels of panchayat, during election, spend a lot more money than the members spend in their election, since their area of operation is much wider. This money, needless to say is amassed from corrupt practices from various government projects that come under their jurisdiction, once they are in office.

Suggestion: Election for the post of members of middle and district level of panchayat should be abolished. The representatives of the lower level of panchayats should be made members of the higher levels of panchayat. This way the lower level of panchayats would be able to control the working of higher levels of panchayats. All sarpanch of a village should be made members of the block panchayat. They should elect one member amongst themselves as the block chairperson. In the same way chairpersons of each block should elect one member as the chairperson of the district panchayat. The sarpanch of the gram Sabha should act as a bridge between the village and the block. He should inform the block panchayat of all the decisions taken by the gram sabha and in turn inform the gram sabhas of the decisions taken by the block panchayat.

This way, through the sarpanch of their village, the gram sabha will be able to take control of the activities of the block gram sabha. By extending this system the block chairpersons will act as a conduit and will be able to take control of the activities of the district level of panchayats.

#### Transparency in documents

Problem: In spite of right to information act it is difficult to obtain information about the working methodology and decisions made by the various levels of the panchayats. In many areas where people have asked information related to working of panchayat from the sarpanch and the government officials, many cases have come to light where the people have been victimized. It is a common occurrence where the sarpanch in collusion with the police has registered false cases against such people. At many a places people have been attacked with intent to kill.

Suggestion: To bring about transparency in the working of all levels of the panchayat, the documents related to works should be available freely. All documents related to gram, block and district panchayats should be available for scrutiny. Such a system should be devised where any one could inspect documents related to works without giving an application. For such purpose two days in week should be reserved for a limited time in which this inspection could be carried out by common man. If some one demands a copy of any document, than he should get the photo copy of the document within seven days after paying the necessary charges. In case of any violation, the gram Sabha should have the power to punish the erring government employee.

#### Introduction of Lokpal

There is endemic corruption rooting out of a basic problem that there is no accountability of a government servant or an elected representatives of the people. This gives freedom to both elected representatives and government servants to indulge in acts of financial embezzlement of  funds  that  belong  to  the  people.  The  courts  are  already  reeling  under  the  pressure  of mounting cases that are pending with them and many times it takes a life time for a case to come to a conclusion. Justice delayed is justice denied.

Therefore, Lokpal bill is being proposed. This is an independent institution, which will look into cases of corruption against the legislature, executive and the judiciary. Lokpal will look into corruption cases against the central government employees and the Lokayukta will look into corruption cases against the employees of the state governments.

Lokpal is within the frame work of transparency in operation. Lokpal is subservient to the people and not above. Just the way people give executive power to the Lokpal/Lokayukta to act against the dishonest government employees, in the same way Lokpal's office is also subject to scrutiny. People will have the power to recall Lokpal, if Lokpal is found to be corrupt,

Problem: There is no effective remedy in the existing law if provisions of the panchayat law are being violated. Like the working of gram Sabha is thwarted, certain section of society members are not being allowed  to  attend  gram  Sabha  meetings,  the  minutes  of  the  meeting  are  not  being recorded properly. Under such circumstances district officials are supposed to take action but they under the influence of the local political leaders do not conduct an impartial inquiry.

Fears are expressed that influential people from higher castes in many areas will not let the people from backward class attend the meetings of the gram Sabha. Even if they are allowed then they will not be given chance to voice their opinion. Even if they are allowed to express their opinion and demands then the recording in the minutes of the meeting would not be included.

Suggestion: Therefore, it is suggested that to listen to such complaints and take time bound actions lokpal should be appointed. In Kerala such a system is in operation with positive results.

It is suggested that Lokpal should be appointed on the state level. The work of Lokpal would be to solve problems related to violation of gram panchayat's laws and disputes. The Lokpal will also take steps to implement various provisions of the gram panchayat law.

The selection process of Lokpal should be totally transparent and should be by general participation of the people. In order for it to be effective and time bound, it should be given all necessary rights and resources.

If someone reports that the meetings of gram Sabhas are not taking place regularly or some sections of society are not allowed to attend the meeting or not allowed to voice their opinion, or the minutes of the meeting are not being recorded properly then it will be Lokpal's duty to conduct an inquiry into it. If it is found that there is truth in such a report then either he himself or through his representative arrange gram Sabha and makes sure that such incidents do not take place and meetings are conducted regularly.

#### Ban on interference of the state government

Problem: Under  the  present  system  of  panchayati  raj,  the state  governments  send directives  to  the panchayats all the time. Because of this the panchayats have turned into a useless government departments processing paper. Instead of tackling the problems of the people of their areas the sarpanchs are busy in taking care of the directives of the government. The directives pertain to the date when the gram sabha will take place, what will be the agenda of the meeting, what all committees will be formed and how will they be formed and how will they operate? All such decisions are taken in the secretariat of the state governments, located in capital cities, instead of the gram sabhas. The state governments try to take all small and big decisions related to lives of the people of the village. This has resulted in indifferent attitude of members in the work of sabha, in loss of freedom of the gram sabhas and its panchayats.

It probably is believed by the government that people on the village level need spoon feeding and if left to them then it will result in a state of chaos. They will not be able to take decision on the issues of education, health care, warehousing products, irrigation and many others in their villages. This is a far fetched thought because there are plenty of examples where villagers have proven that they could administer, if given a free hand.

It is the business of government to govern but government displays inept and shoddy handling of the administration. It interferes with peoples lives on all levels small and big. Result is that people take no initiative in the process of governance and governance therefore is no ones baby; neither of the people or of the government.

Suggestion: The right to give direction to the gram sabha should be withdrawn from the state government. Panchayats should be treated as the third independent body of administration. State governments should be allowed to send directives to the panchayats once in a while but sending in directives on a regular basis and interfering in panchayat's day to day activities must be stopped.

Let the people decide what they want. Let them decide what their priorities are and how they would like to deal with the problems that they face. Once they are given freedom to choose, freedom to operate and free funds, they will excel in governing themselves.

# When Citizens take Decisions

Let us see if self governance is introduced and the power is given in the hands of people then how doors would open of opportunities for progress in various fields. In fact there would be possibilities of progress in every field but we are taking only few examples below.

#### Improvement in education

Today the schools are in bad shape. Teaching is not proper; the children do not have desks to sit, water to drink, fans and urinals are not available. Whenever complaints are sent to the government then no action is taken on those complaints.

If government decides to send free fund then people can, in a gram Sabha, decide what essential things are to be provided to the children in school. They will be able to take direct decisions. They would not be obliged to seek some officer’s consent or from a politician or will not be obliged to seek permission from the state government.

In the same way  all schools have shortage of teachers. One teacher teaches 200 to 300 children. Sometimes only one teacher teaches children of at least three or four classes at the same time. This type of education is ineffective and wasteful for children. In the name of education a mockery is going on. If power is given to people then they would look at the problem of shortage of teachers in gram sabhas meeting and employ more teachers that are needed. They would not be required to write to state government to create more posts, fill more vacancies and employ staff. They will decide this issue in the gram Sabha meetings and employ themselves as many teachers as may be needed.

The teachers who are employed even today they do not teach properly. Some come only at the end of the month to collect their salaries and some who come, sit under trees and pass time gossiping with each other instead of teaching and the children then play. If gram sabhas are empowered then the teachers would be accountable to them and the teachers would be subjected to questioning. If need arises then the gram Sabha could punish them, too. The gram sabhas will have the power to make teachers tow their line.

### Improvement in health services

In the same way let us take health services. The Doctors in village hospital do not treat the patients properly and use abusive language, they are rude, they do not come regularly and the medicines are stolen from the hospital. If the gram sabhas had power then they would be accountable to the Sabha, which could directly question them and if need be, punish them suitably.

If there is shortage of medicine then they would be able to purchase medicine from the free fund that is made available to them from the government. This will directly reduce the corruption. Today no action can be taken against the corrupt officials. If gram Sabha has the power then it will be able to question the corrupt officers and punish them.

### Getting rid of Naxalism

By giving power to the gram sabhas there would be direct effect on the naxal movement. We will take an example to understand this. In Lohandigura village of Chattisgarh Tata steel wanted to set up a plant. They needed land of at least ten villages which all fell under notified area.  Here Panchayat Extension of Scheduled Areas (PESA) law is in force. This law states that if the government wants to acquire land under these areas then it has to seek permission from the gram sabhas of that area.  The government wrote to the gram sabhas seeking their permission. The meetings of the gram Sabhas took place but there the people rejected the request of the government and refused to part with their land. The government again sent in a request for acquisition of land. Again the gram Sabha meetings took place. The people put up fifteen conditions in front of the government, which if accepted would form as a basis to let the government acquire the land. Those requests were legitimate. There were conditions like; amount of compensation to be paid for the land, planting of trees for every tree that is cut, every person from a family to be offered employment etc. All demands were fair. When these demands went to the government, the government accepted none but on the other hand the government acquired the land using force by sending police. The people of the village wrote messages for the Naxals on the walls of the village houses seeking their support. It is heard that the ten villages then joined the Naxal ranks.

If people had the power to take decisions regarding their own village then they would not have joined the Naxal ranks or would not have supported the Naxals. Without the base and without the support of people Naxals could not have grown.

Suggestion: It was people’s voice and their genuine demands that were suppressed. It was the state of helplessness and anger that led the people in the willing arms of armed Naxals. If the law had given them the power to decide what they wanted then they would have never joined the Naxals. This is the kind of base and the support of the people on which thrives Naxalism.

#### Success in containing Alcoholism

In many wards of Delhi, meetings of Welfare Associations are taking place from last one year in various localities. The residents, local leaders and government officials in the association meetings deliberate on the issues of development of their own areas. Sonia Vihar is one such locality. In a meeting of the Association some youngsters demanded that the Liquor shop was far away from the colony and, therefore, a shop should be opened nearby. There were a lot of elders, present in the meeting, who were regular drinkers of alcohol but projected an image of being saints, started a discourse on the vices of drinking alcohol and advised that such a move was harmful for the local residents.  In this open forum no one supported the motion to open the liquor shop and so the proposal to open the shop was shot down. It is very difficult for anyone to get a proposal which is not in the interest of the community to be passed in an open forum.

In today’s laws the permission to open a shop of liquor is to be taken from the government officials or local leaders. No one ever bothers to ask the people if they like it or not. Political leaders and the government officials accept bribes and give permission to open the shops. If a law is enacted that no liquor shop can be opened without the consent of the gram sabhas or the local resident association then it will become very difficult to open the liquor shops. Such a law will be a great step in curbing the prevalence of alcoholism in the society.

#### Freedom from poverty, hunger and unemployment

If the power to decide is given in the hands of the people then it will affect the status of poverty, hunger and unemployment. We had mentioned earlier in the book that if free fund is made available to people then in the meetings of gram Sabha people will establish the status of poor, the hungry, the unemployed and uneducated. They will decide who should be given free ration, who should get housing and who should get free education. Such a system would be for the welfare of all.

If someone wanted to start an enterprise, than he could get loan at concessional rates. Today that person takes loan from the moneylenders at exorbitant rates, of right up to 150% per annum. He gets entangled in a debt trap and keeps paying interest for his whole life time.

Many farmers commit suicide and the main reason is the debt that they take from moneylenders, which they are unable to pay. Under new dispensation they can get loans at reasonable rates from the gram Sabha

If gram sabhas are given free funds than the local villagers can set up small enterprises like a soap factory or a rice mill or an oil extraction plant which can cater to the demands of the village. Such enterprises would enhance the prospect of employment for the rural economy.

Flow of free funds to village gram Sabha is a life giving formula that can enhance the prospects of increase in wealth, reduce poverty and increase employment.

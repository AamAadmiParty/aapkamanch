# Present Anomalies of Panchayati Raj

There is nothing new, the people argue that the panchayats exists even now. Through the panchayati raj the villagers are connected with the government. The anomaly is that after independence in the name of panchayati raj the kind of set up that is created fosters corruption because it gives the rights and power to the political leaders, government officers instead of people.

Instead of strengthening the administration on the village level, unfortunately panchayats have become a conduit of implementing various schemes of state government. The schemes are made either in the center or in the capitals of state governments. Panchayats are given orders to only implement them. These schemes sometimes have no relevance to ambitions and aspirations of the people.

There are many anomalies in the panchayati raj administration. Broadly the following strangulate the system's capabilities.

1. Panchayats have very few rights and powers. There is no control what so ever of the panchayats on government employees and government funds.

2. Whatever rights that have been given to the panchayats, vest with the pradhan or the sarpanch. The Sarpanch is the soul of the panchayat. All decisions are taken by him. Gram sabhas (or people) have no right to veto his decision. In, The Gram Sabha can give suggestion to the sarpanch.  However, the sarpanch is free to either accept or reject their advice.

3. Therefore, most of the sarpanchs have become corrupt. And the people are not empowered to take any action against them.

4. Only the Collector has been empowered to take action against an incompetent, irresponsible and corrupt sarpanch. The Collector can initiate any action against the sarpanch. He can also suspend  him.  Therefore, most  of  the  sarpanchs  are  scared of  the Collector and the Block Development Officer, who is a subordinate of the Collector. The Collector of a district is an employee of the state government, in much the same way as the Governor is an employee of the central government. Fortunately, the Governor does not have any rights to interfere in the affairs of the state government. Unfortunately, the Collector has unlimited power to interfere in the affairs of the state government. The state governments, therefore, through the Collector interferes in the affairs of the Gram Sabha or the people.

Let us see some of the anomalies of the present Panchayat Raj.

#### Tree Plantation Campaign in Bhondsi Village

In a village people need water for irrigation and drinking, health services and hospitals, schools and colleges, electricity and many more. As it was mentioned     before, every aspect of life and living is controlled by a government department. Each department functions independently. The road department has no connection with the sanitation department. Health department has no connection with the education department. The water department has no connection with the horticulture department Each department has certain milestones to achieve during one financial year.

The village of Bhondsi near Delhi had very few trees, so the forest department was given the task of planting trees. The work was not carried out properly. It was handled by inept and inefficient employees of the government and the target was nowhere near completion. To complete the target in a short time seeds were sprinkled over large tract of land from a helicopter. The seeds were of Keekar tree that grows very fast. The forest department had to show that they have been able to plant a forest.    The forest department did not bother that Keekar consumes a lot of water which it sucks from its land. The water table fell drastically in Bhondsi disrupting the water management.

There was no participation of the people of Bhondsi. No suggestions were taken from the people to find what kind of trees should be planted.  Panchayat or the people have no control over any decision of any department whether good or bad.

#### Garbage in the City of Kutumbakum

Kutumbakum is a village near Chennai. The Tamil Nadu Government was searching land for dumping the garbage of six neighboring cities. Some bright government officers identified a large tract of land,

measuring about 100 Acres, near this village which was used for grazing cattle. About 5000 cattle used to graze on this land. 70 acres of land was acquired by the order of the Collector of the city. This land was then used for dumping the refuge of six cities. Needless to mention the villagers of Kutumbakum were extremely angry. They were neither consulted nor were their wishes of having this land as a grazing ground given a thought.    They had to hunt for fresh grazing ground.   The garbage dumped near the village created a health hazard for the locals. But when the villagers filed a suit against the government, they lost, because the collector was well within his rights to acquire this land.

Is this what Panchayati Raj is? Where the panchayat has no power, the sarpanch has no power and not to mention the people have no power.   Where the state government through the Collector's power can deprive the people of land and create a garbage dump against the    wishes of their gram Sabha, the Sarpanch and the people. There is no sanity in a system that over ride the wishes of its people

#### A joke named NREGA (National Rural Employment Guarantee)

This act guarantees hundred days of wage employment in a financial year to a rural household whose adult members offer to do unskilled manual work. Thousands of crores have been allotted under this scheme to various states in the country. Hundreds of cases are coming up small and big where the wages are being paid to non existing ghost workers. Where the wages have been paid for the work are less than what should be paid under this scheme or the wages are paid for less number of days and claimed for hundred days by coterie of government officials right from district collector to BDO to Sarpanch.

Four percent of the allotted money is known as contingency fund that is specifically used for the welfare of women and children working under the schemes of NREGA. This four percent is used for providing water and sanitation for the workers, welfare centres like a crèche or a dispensary. In rural areas no such facilities are ever provided to the poor worker's family. This contingency fund is siphoned off by the government officials who are connected with NREGA running into hundreds of crores.

Government schemes are formulated at the centre or the state capitals. The funds that are made available under these schemes flow from top to the bottom. Each official is hell bent on spending money on his level only. That money which is meant for the welfare of the people at the lowest rung never reaches them. Every official spends that money on his own level. The poor worker does not know whom to make a complaint. The tax money paid by honest individuals is thus squandered on such grand schemes where government has no capability of implementing them.

How can money be siphoned off on all levels is a question that comes to the mind so very often? One of the biggest reasons is that there is no accountability of any government official. This is what needs to be corrected.

#### Panchayats do not have authority to even buy a broom

If a Sarpanch does not attend gram Sabha meetings, is inept and corrupt then the Collector has the power to take action against the sarpanch.  He can institute an inquiry or even remove him as sarpanch.

But a  collector has about thousand to two thousand villages under him and it is impossible for him to know how good or bad a sarpanch is; whether he is discharging his duties properly or not? On the other hand the people of the village would. The power to take action against the sarpanch is not given to the people, when it should be rightfully theirs.  Taking advantage of this fact many a collector   has become corrupt and has started the tradition of taking protection money which in hindi is known as "Hafta". No action is taken against the sarpanchs who pay this "Hafta" but false cases are initiated against the sarpanch who resist this protection money. They are forced to tow the line and are made to do what is not right.

This example gives us an insight into the working of Panchayati raj system where politicians sitting at the state government levels can control the Sarpanch, the Pradhan and the leader of a village through the authority of Collector and make them dance to their wishes.

Though a contact is awarded by the U.P. government to supply equipment like pick axe and brooms for cleaning  up  villages,  the  contractor  is  instructed  by  the  B.D.O.  to  deliver  the  material  and collect payment from the sarpanchs. If a sarpanch does not make the payment he suffers harassment at the hands of the B.D.O.  .

What    was shown on the paper was    not what had actually happened.  The material was paid for by thousands of sarpanchs but on paper it was    the state government that had bought all the equipment. This fraudulent activity of the state government   gets buried in the files.

Under the "Education for All" program, much the same thing is happening all the time in the villages. The right to buy educational material against this program is under the Panchayat. But the same high handedness is visible here too. It is seen in various districts of Uttar Pradesh that instead of transferring the allotted money of "Education for all" to the "Village education fund" this money is directly used by the  state  government.  Contracts  are  awarded  for,  example,  towards  repair  and  maintenance  of electrical work in all schools directly at the state level. The contractor carries out sub standard, shoddy work and sometimes not what was required. But the payment for this work is forced upon the sarpanch who is helpless.

The  Sarpanch is not supposed to make any payment for works authorized by the state government but since the  people of the village have no power and neither does the sarpanch they can do nothing, even more so because  of the tilt of power  towards the centre.

#### Panchayat Secretary – Of the state Government or of the Panchayat?

Employees and the secretary of the panchayat are appointed by the state government as per the law. The key responsibility areas (KRA) are also decided by the state government. The question is who is the better judge of the capabilities and abilities of these employees other than the people of the village and the sarpanch for whom they are working? What is the nature of the work to be done and when it needs to be done should be decided by the people of the village and not by the state government. .

#### The story of backward region grant fund

"Backward region grant fund" is a scheme muted by the central government for the backward areas of the country. This fund is meant to be   dispersed to implement various schemes in the backward areas of the district depending upon the needs of the people. It is the prerogative of the gram Sabha to start the projects that they want. There are about 250 districts where this scheme is in operation. Sirsa and Mahendergarh are two backward districts in Haryana where this scheme is being implemented. When we visited these two districts, we realized that there were no gram Sabhas and yet backward region grant fund was being utilized by the State government. It was found that the money was transferred under the account of District Collector. The collector distributed the fund, according to the provision of the law, to the gram Sabha , on receiving the schemes forwarded by the said Gram Sabha. But the collector used the fund indiscriminately without getting any proposal from Gram Sabha.

Many political leaders exert pressure on the district collector and get works done using the backward region grant fund. A political leader had a big tract of agricultural land in a village. He pressurized the collector and got many works done around his land. Had this decision to use the fund been left to the gram Sabhas then the work around the neta's land would not have seen the light of the day.

Certain young boys in the district of Sirsa conducted various gram sabhas and made proposals for use of backward region grant fund.  Despite the fact that the provision of the law is very clear that proposals forwarded by the gram Sabha will be accepted by the collector and the und dispersed, accordingly, the collector has not deemed it fit to accept the proposals forwarded by these 18 villages or sanctioned the funds, even though one year has gone by.

#### Conclusions

There are innumerable examples all over the country that prove that in today's panchayati raj, panchayats have no role to play in the administrative or the political set up of the country.

Gram sabhas or people, panchayat or sarpanch have been given no power. no rights to question the authority of the BDO, the collector or their political masters.

For effective development of the country, the people/gram Sabha/sarpanch must be given powers to question the BDO/collector/political masters for their acts of omission and commission. Their free run on the country's resources and wealth has to be checked.

That can only happen if the people have the power to take decision at the grass root level. That grass root level begins from the villagers and the city dwellers.

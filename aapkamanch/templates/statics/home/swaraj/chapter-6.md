# Citizens are the Masters

We had adopted the model of democracy after the independence in 1947, Government by the people, of the people and for the people.

Once in five years “We the people” choose our representative from amongst ourselves and empower them to take decisions for “We the people”. But as soon as the elected representatives are installed in the parliament, the power goes to their head and they become arrogant and autocratic. The power that “We the people” give to the representatives for life and liberty of “We the people” is totally misused. Decisions taken by the representatives are not for “We the people” but for “I the people”.

The basic principal of democracy is violated. Of the people, by the people is alright but FOR THE PEOPLE
is missing in this matrix.

> This is what needs to change.

The representatives of the people should be accountable to “We the People”. Once the vote is obtained the elected leaders are there in Parliament or Legislative assemblies for five years. They are then not accountable to the people whom they were representing. The leaders do what they want or what suits their interest. The people’s power is limited to electing their representatives only.

A change must be brought about where the people take all decisions and the implementation is left in the hands of the elected representatives. Another change that needs to be brought about is ability of the people to recall the self serving elected representatives, inept and corrupt. If such legislation comes in force then the same representatives would bend backwards and forward in front of the people.

We need the control in the hands of the people. How can control be given to a population of hundred crore people? Is it possible and everyone wonders!

It is possible? Constitution has recognized the village assemblies or gram sabhas. Gram Sabha is not panchayat. Panchayat constitutes of village pradhan, the sarpanch, the appointee of the government in the ward and some prominent inhabitants of the village. But gram Sabha is the open assembly of the people of the village. This joint meeting is the place where local matters are discussed.

#### Need control over government servants

The right to take all decisions about the village and its organizational set up should be of the villagers. The need is to bring about an amendment to the existing Panchayati raj and other prevailing laws where this power should be enshrined in the people of the village. The gram sabha should have the power to stop the salary of a teacher who is not coming to the school or not teaching properly.

If a Doctor does not take care of its patients then the gram Sabha should have power to stop his salary. If a ration shop does not distribute ration properly or indulges in black market then the gram Sabha should have powers to cancel his license. If the Station House officer of a police station does not register

a report and indulges in extra constitutional methods against the people, then the gram Sabha should have powers to stop his salary, too.

Do you think that it would bring about a change? Off course it would change everyone from the errant SHO to the inept teacher to a corrupt ration shop keeper. After all they are now accountable to the people and they know that the real power now rests with the gram Sabha or the people. They all will make sure that they remain on the right side of the people by serving the interest of the people.

Appointment of the teacher in a village should be done by the gram Sabha. It has been seen that the state governments employ thousands of teachers by fraudulent means. The quality of teachers who have paid bribes to get jobs is questionable. How would they teach children?

Under RTI (Right to information) act it was found that in many a schools, up to class ten, of Jharkhand state have not a single teacher. In Vamani higher secondary school, Kanuga, Saraikela, Kharsawa has 310 children but not a single teacher. In a school of Siroom there are 435 children in ten classes but there is only one teacher, that too for Bangla language. Currently it is the duty of the state government to provide teachers in school. Many a times people in the above mentioned places wrote to the state governments but no answer ever came.

Should  we  keep  waiting  for  the  favours  of  the  state  government  when  the  teachers  would  be appointed? This is a cruel joke played with the lives of millions of children spread across the nation. Their lives are being compromised and sacrificed.

This system needs to be changed. The people of the community should be given the power to appoint and dismiss the teachers. The people who go to a hospital for getting medical treatment should be empowered to appoint and suspend the Doctor. The administration should go directly in the hands of people. All government employees should be appointed by the gram Sabha and also suspended or dismissed by the gram Sabha. This right or the power to appoint and suspend all government employees must rest with the gram sabhas.

This will greatly benefit the country. The state governments appoint thousands of teachers from the cities to reach in the villages at a salary of Rs.15000/ per month but even then they do not want to work in the villages. But if the Gram sabhas are allowed to appoint the teachers then the teachers appointed from the village will work for Rs.5000/ per month. If they do not teach then they could be suspended by the gram sabhas.

By changing the law steps should be taken that gram sabhas should have power to call any BDO or employee of the government on the village level to attend their meetings and to obey orders passed by the gram Sabha. On the district or block level the people could give orders to government employees. The people should have the power to summon the ration inspector, summon the BDO, summon the tahsildar, summon the Sub Divisional Magistrate or summon the Collector of the district. If the government officer does not obey the decisions of the gram Sabha then the people should have powers to punish the erring official.

The power to appoint and discharge the employees on block and district levels should rest with gram sabhas through the office bearers of the block panchayat and district panchayats.

The people should have right to ask for information about any matter pertaining to their village, from any government officer up to the state level. Inappropriate schemes are formulated by the state government for the  villages. Therefore, the villagers should have right to know about the type of decisions that are being taken and schemes that are formulated for the village. The gram Sabha should have this right to know.

#### Control over government money

What ever money that is allotted to villages should be free fund and not the fund which is tied to one or the other scheme. There are so many schemes like old age pension, widow pension, Indra awas yojana and NRGA or many more. Villages do not need any scheme that the government moots because only a fraction of the money allotted in these schemes reach the people it is meant for.

The villagers do not need these schemes but need free funds. If for the above funds lets say rupees five crore is sent to a village send only three crore but that three crore should be a free fund that can be utilized by the villagers as per their needs. The villagers in their gram Sabha should decide jointly as to how much money is needed for irrigation and how much for widow pension. How much money is to be spent on education and how much should be spent on health care. Let villagers/ gram Sabha be the decision makers.

The villagers will decide what is the criteria that categorises one below the poverty line (BPL) and? In Hong Kong a person without an Air Conditioner is treated as a person who is BPL. In Delhi a rickshaw puller is able to make rupees five thousand a month and yet is not able to make two ends meet. He is forced to live in shanties in dirty surroundings. But rupee five thousand is enough in a village where that same person can live decently.

The criteria, therefore, would be different for different state and geographical locations. Sitting in Delhi no uniform policies can be adopted. What is BPL in Delhi is not BPL, for say in a place like Kalahandi.

Leave this to the social set up of a village. Let them decide that who among them does not have a house and is in urgent need of the same. So he gets a house under such scheme. Under Indra Vikas Yojana the government makes funds available for two houses in a village, which in turn, with connivance of corrupt government employees, are given to people who do not need them.   Let the villagers decide who is without house and who is suffering from malnutrition. Let them decide what the need of their society is. Let the people of gram Sabha allot funds to the hungry and funds for the homeless. Let the people of the Sabha decide how much money should be spent on education so that every child of the village can become literate. It would be the collective responsibility of the people to provide for its people funds that have come actually from the people’s tax money. This would be an ideal way of democracy where the wealth of the people will recycle and grow.

In villages and town people raise loans from Loan Sharks at exorbitant rates of interest. When they want to start a small business or start farming then the gram Sabha can disburse loan from the available funds to the needy at reasonable rates of interest. This is possible only if free fund is available to the gram sabhas and not fund that is tied to one scheme or the other.

Toady many a farmers are committing suicide in several villages of the country. These are the people who have been driven to take such measure because of economic reasons but if the gram sabhas have the funds available then such suicides will stop in the country.

Many a times the harvested grain starts to rot due to untimely rain. The harvested grain is not stored in warehouse, which causes huge financial loss to the farmers. The farmers could have made warehouse only if they had funds available to them. The government is hardly able to look at their crying need.

There is a small village near Chennai by the name of Kutumbacum whose sarpanch is Ilango. He is the first chemical engineer who left his job fifteen years back and decided to become sarpanch of his village. There are about thousand families in the village. It was estimated that people buy things of daily use to the tune of rupees fifty lac a month. These are things like soap, cooking oil, food stuff and others. Ilango believed that at least 80 percent things could be produced in the village itself. He got a lot of cottage industry started in the village itself that started to produce oil, food stuff for consumption and bricks for the houses.

If free fund is available to the villagers or the gram sabhas then all this can be achieved by all the villages that can spur the economy of the village and the country. This free fund available in the hands of people, not in the hands of corrupt and inept government employees, can help them put up small production units for things that the village needs most.

In many villages of a block near Pune a successful experiment is in progress. Earlier between June and September people used to face severe financial crises. During this period people used to run towards cities for employment or take loan from the money lender at exorbitant rates of 100-150%. If villagers took 100 kg of grain then to the money lenders they used to give back 150 kg.  after four months. In spite of such a high rates of interest that was paid by the villagers they were still under the clutches of these loan sharks who would make these borrowers work for free in the fields of lender. This had adverse effect on the borrowers who used to get into a vicious cycle. For 100 kg grain that they bought, they paid back 150 kg., which is fifty percent higher. In other words they were unable to pay back this loan and went back to the same money lender again and again.

But in this block an organization started a Grain Bank. The people created an association and this association loaned grain to the members of the society according to the need of the members. Instead of returning 150 Kg. grain, now they had to return only 125 kg. grain only. In four years time the farmers have been able to repay the entire loan amount to this association. There is no fear of the money lender, no working free for him and freedom from the loan. Now, the villagers have surplus grain that is being stored by the association. This experiment is running successfully in about 150 villages in the neighborhood.

If the villagers could get free fund then similar grain banks could be started in all villages which could be free from hunger and the clutches of the loan sharks to write their own story of success.

All schemes of government should be stopped. These schemes get entangled into a complicated web of government officials on the village and state level, powerful bureaucrats and their political masters who are neither accountable to the people nor they could be prosecuted. Only 10 % of the money under these grand schemes reach the people rest is lost or embezzled in transit. “We the people” squirm and squeal helplessly and watch the drain of our own tax money without recourse to any one.

But if all schemes by the government are stopped and free fund made available to the gram sabhas or the people, then a revolution will come in the country that can erase poverty, hunger and unemployment.

#### Will corruption increase if gram sabhas are empowered?

It is believed by many that free fund sent directly to the gram sabhas will be misused by the people. How will it be misused was our question? If a sum of rupees three crore is made available to gram Sabha then it is possible that all villagers decide to keep this money or in other words distribute amongst themselves and not use for their own development. Our reply is then let them do this. Even today what is happening that the entire money is embezzled by the politicians, the officials, the collector, the BDO, the tehsildar. If the villagers have decided to keep this money by themselves, in a joint meeting, then let it be so. The people’s money has gone back to the people and not to the middlemen.

But villagers will not do so. What do you think who loves a child more, his mother or the secretary of education? It is evident that it is the mother. So how do you assume that the villagers would decide that they  do not want education for their children, health services for sick and the aged? They would naturally want schools for education and hospitals for the sick and want all means of development of their village. Therefore, such a scene that the money will be distributed amongst them without a thought to development will never happen. The money will go into cottage industry, in building of roads and canals, for horticulture and agriculture and for warehouses. To think that this money would be distributed amongst them is a figment of imagination.

There is one more possibility that the sarpanch may usurp all this money by taking false signature of people without calling a village meeting. This is possible. It is happening even today. The money may come as free fund or in funds tied to schemes; if the sarpanch is corrupt then the money is embezzled. The money would go to the villagers or not, the fate entirely depends on the fact that the sarpanch is honest or corrupt. It also depends on the fact that the people are aware of their rights.

In today’s scenario people do not even know how much money has been allotted to any of the projects and how much money has trickled in the village sarpanch’s hands. In the new dispensation that we are proposing there is going to be transparency on the size of allocation of funds and the power to dispose off that fund the way the villagers want. Once the people have the power to raise their voices against the sarpanch, the BDO, the Collector and the state government then there are very few chances that this money could be siphoned off easily by all the concerned officials and politicians.

When people raise their voices then more free funds will flow, the sarpanch will be forced to honesty. Today the fund is siphoned off by the chain of people who are handling that fund but the real people, for  whom  this  fund  is  meant,  have  no  say  in  the  disbursement  of  the  fund.  The  chosen  few,  by fraudulent means, are the ones who get involved and no one else has any interest in it. In Indra Vikas Yojana, the sarpanch takes bribes from three chosen individuals who are the beneficiaries and rest of the people in the village are hardly concerned. They have no power to question the decisions of the sarpanch who in turn is blessed by the chain of the higher ups. In a scenario where this money comes under free fund then the fund would be under the glare of all the villagers. The fund has to be disbursed by a consensus vote in an open assembly of people. The people of the village would be together and it would be very difficult for sarpanch to act un justly. This would be a great step in curbing corruption because the fund is under the scrutiny of the people.

Today the people have no voice, no way to take action against the organized mafia within the government machinery. In self governed gram Sabha the Sabha will have power to question the actions of government officials and also will have ability to punish and if required suspend them.

#### Citizen’s opinion should be taken to formulate policies and law:

As per our constitution, members of the legislative assembly (MLA) and members of the parliament (MP) are the nominated members on the block and state levels of the panchayats. But the constitution has given them no responsibility. In our opinion, if a law is tabled in the parliament or in the state level legislative assembly, then they should be duty bound to distribute the salient points of this law to people on block and state level. They should then discuss the nitty gritty of the law and take the opinion of the people  about the proposed law. The people will discuss the same in gram sabhas and the common opinion of the gram sabhas should be put forth in the parliament through the MP and MLA’s.

Today we vote and send our representatives to the parliament or legislative assembly. They are our representatives first and then members of parties like BJP or congress or any other party that they belong to. It is obligatory on their part to know the opinion of the constituents before voting for any legislation or policies of the government. But to pass legislation in the parliament, whips are issued by the party presidents like Sonia Gandhi for congress and all members of the party vote in favour for the proposition. If it is BJP then Advani or Gadkari will issue a whip and all members would vote in favour or against the proposition. Mayawati will make all members vote in a manner that she wants. Party then becomes supreme for our representatives and the people are totally sidelined. Their interest or opinion is seldom taken care of.

This autocracy of the high command has to be stopped. What the people want, the representative should present in the parliament or the legislative assemblies. If this happens then it would be direct control of the people on the legislations being formulated in the parliament or the legislative assembly.

Then it would become very difficult for the government to pass unjust and ridiculous bills like “Nuclear liability bill”. Then it will become very difficult to pass a bill in the parliament under the pressure of a foreign company or a foreign country. The citizens will, then, be able to pass any legislation that they want.

#### Control over natural resources:

The people should have direct control over water, forest, minerals and other natural resources

##### Land

It has been pointed out earlier that whenever an industrialist wants to set up a factory in some areas then they take permission from the state government. Corrupt officials and politicians of the state government accept bribes and sell this land to the industrialist at concessional rates. No one consults the farmers if they want to do farming or want to sell the land and do something else. Their opinion, their welfare and their livelihood is not on the minds of the state government.

We are seeking a change in the law that directs a company to put up an application for permission to set up a factory in a gram Sabha in whose vicinity the land falls. His application for permission will then be decided in the gram sabhas in whose vicinity the land falls. The state government will then take permission from gram sabhas of the areas because the sale will affect the live hood of people of the area. The application for selling of land will then be made to the panchayati secretary. He will put forth the proposal in the gram sabhas where he will take the permission of the Sabha or the people. The people will decide if they want to part with the land or not. If they want to sell the land then they will decide the terms of the sale. The industrial house can buy the land on the terms of the sale ratified by the gram Sabha in an open meeting.

In the same way if the state or central wants to acquire a village then they must send in an application to the panchayat and enter in a dialogue with the gram Sabha directly.

There are many a villages where only 10-15 % villagers own the land. Others till the land on contract. The compensation for sold or acquired land goes to the land owners and others who were doing manual labour not only get nothing but even loose their lively hood. It would become the duty of gram Sabha to take care the interest of such labourers when the land is acquired or sold.

Gram Sabha must have direct control over the land that falls in their area.

##### Mines

On deposits of minor minerals gram sabhas should have the direct control. Who should have control over the large deposits of minerals. It is indeed accepted that the entire country is the owner of large deposits of minerals on which no one will have any objection. How these minerals would be deployed for general welfare of the society at large is a complicated question. The right to give permit to mine the minerals is with the state and the central government. They have misused this right. They, after taking bribes, have in fact sold the right to mine at throw away prices to various companies.

Should this right to issue permit for mining of minerals be given to the gram Sabha? It is argued that the mining companies are so powerful that they can bring in a lot of pressure on villagers and can offer inducements that it would become extremely difficult for the villagers to resist.

The solution to this problem will come in some middle path. A national policy on how should the minerals be used, how much should be exported and how much they should be extracted must be taken after due deliberation at the gram Sabha level. On the basis of the national policy, right to give permit on the village, block or state level for mining of minerals is given to all the gram sabhas that are affected.

##### Forest

The gram sabhas should be the direct owner of all small scale businesses of the forest. Contracts for timber and bamboo must not be given without consultation and approval of the gram sabhas, to the contractors. Gram Sabhas should also decide the terms of the contract.

##### Water

The  water sources that fall under the boundaries of a village will automatically be treated as the property of the village. No decision should be taken, like building a dam, on large water resources like river, without the consent of the village sabhas.

### There should be division of work between various levels of government:

A division will have to be carried out of the work between various levels of government departments, government wealth and various corporations. There is division between the works carried out by state and central governments but such a division does not exist between state government and various levels of panchayat.

All decisions pertaining to works to be carried out on the level of village should be taken in the gram sabhas only. The people should decide in gram Sabha as to which works can be carried out. The details should be made of properties like roads, sewers etc. that fall under the jurisdiction of their village only. Name all government agencies that provide services to their village. Identify village centered school that gives education to their children only. A law should be enacted that transfers all works related to the village along with government agencies that provide services and wealth that falls under village jurisdiction. The fund required for maintaining the wealth, to carry out works and expenses of the agencies along with government employees should be transferred to the gram panchayat.

First, a list of works should be made which are village centric. Then, a list of works should be made in every block where certain works, properties fall under two villages. In the same way a list should be made on the level of the district where works of two or more blocks along with wealth and government agencies are common for many villages and blocks. Funds and the government employees required to maintain properties or carry out works should be transferred to the villages, blocks or districts as the case may be who will exercise all control over them. If a dispute arises between two villages regarding the jurisdiction of property or works then that dispute should be solved on the level of the block. The disputes on the block levels should be settled on the district level and the disputes on the district level should be solved on the state level.

How the decision will be taken in Swaraj system of governance?

A block panchayat would be constituted by combining all the heads of village under it. Chairpersons of all the block panchayat on the district level will constitute a district panchayat.

The decision that affect, lets say four or five villages, will be taken on the block level. For example, if a road is to be constructed that connects four or five villages then the decisions on that would be under the purview of the block. But all the decisions that are being taken on the block levels must be ratified by each of the village panchayats which are directly affected by the decision of the block. Under no circumstances the decisions can be taken by the block without the consent of the village panchayats. The decisions for common works for three or four blocks will be taken on the district level.  In the same way decisions pertaining to the district levels will be taken on the state level.

It is imperative that the decision at the top level of the pyramid structure, of dispensation, that we are proposing must be ratified by the bottom most layers. In other words the decision on the village level will be accepted by the block level and the decisions of the block level will be accepted by the district level and the decisions of the district levels would be accepted by the state. Once there is a majority consensus only then a decision can be taken.

The state governments are free to take decisions on works that are carried out on state level and are not obliged to involve the opinions of the gram sabhas.

However, gram sabhas would be empowered to put forth their demands on any issue. If five percent of the gram sabhas on the district level pass a proposal then the state government will have to send that proposal to all villages of the district. If fifty percent or more of the gram sabhas ratify that resolution then the state government is duty bound to accept that resolution even if it requires the change in existing law.

### Effect of this on Indian politics

The day the gram sabhas start to operate across the country, with power vested in them, that is the day the people will have direct control over the parliament. It would mean that people will have direct control over the political scene, too. Today there is complete control of corrupt leaders, corrupt parties and criminals over the Indian politics. That control will start to wean. Then people will start to have direct control over politics and governance of this country. This will bring about all inclusive progress, remove unemployment and eradicate poverty.

Only when the power comes directly in the hands of the people, that would be the day true democracy will dawn in the country. If this happens, education will improve, roads will become better, water would be made available, electricity will be in abundance, health services will improve, poverty will go away and that will solve the problem of Naxalism, too.

There is need for sweeping changes in the Panchayat Raj and other laws:

There are many suggestions given at the end of the book. State and central governments can make amendments in the panchayat raj law and other laws on their levels and can impose them. There will be no need for making amendments in the constitution.

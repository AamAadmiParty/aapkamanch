### Some examples of other countries

We have studied some democratic models of establishments that are prevalent in other countries like
United States of America, Brazil and Switzerland.

#### USA Walmart Lost

In the United States no decision on the local level, on the level of a city, and the level of county is taken without the consent of the people. There is a small town by the name Middle Town. On the web site of this town it is displayed that the people of this town meet at 5 PM every Monday evening. This happens in many a town in the US where people congregate in the town hall, discuss their problems and take collective decisions based on which the administration of the town runs.

In the town of Oregon, Walmart wanted to set up a shop. A notice to this effect was circulated to  all the residents of the town.  A meeting was called in the town hall to discuss and deliberate on the issue of Walmart setting  up the shop. This issue was discussed in the town hall at length and people came to this conclusion that the shop will kill all the Mom and Pop shops that were selling goods and services. Walmart was not able to go against the unanimous decision of the community and they could not open the store in the city.

Walmart wanted to come to India too and set up shop. But the decision to let the giant supermarket into the country would mean the death of small enterprises and family businesses. This could lead to massive unemployment and deal a fatal blow to the indigenous market. But the wishes of the people will not be taken into consideration when the permission is granted to Walmart. Though this is a database issue, the decision to give Walmart the welcome nod rests with two people in this country: the Commerce Minister and the Prime Minister.

#### BRAZIL- Budget prepared in the streets

We take example of a small town in Brazil, Porto Agrele. Thirty to forty percent of its population lived in slum clusters. In 1990, “workers Party” formed the government in Porto Agrele. In these slum clusters there were no roads, no sewer connections and there was no drinking water. The people lacked education and therefore, were unlettered. The Workers Party decided that the budget of the town would not be made in the closed rooms of the town hall or in the council of ministers but it would be made  in  the  streets  and  the  colonies  of  the  city.  Porto  Agrele  was  divided into  small  clusters  of dwellings. In the beginning of the year the people met in these designated clusters and decided what they wanted the most. Some wanted the laying and repair of roads, others wanted drinking water pipeline as a priority; then there were some who wanted a proper sewage system and yet others who wanted teachers in schools.   Different people had different demands.

All the demands were compiled and these demands were the basis of a budget. Why should the budget be made behind the closed doors of an assembly hall? It should be actually made, in streets and towns, taking into consideration the needs and aspiration of the people.

What is a budget, if not the use of public money for the welfare of the people?

This experiment proved fruitful. The party has ruled for the last fifteen years without losing an election. A report of the World Bank states that this experiment is responsible for development of Porto Agrele. Earlier there was no water but now 98 % of the households have water. 87% of the house holds have sewer connections and cent percent people are now educated.  Earlier corruption  was rampant, but the World Bank report states that it has now reduced considerably.

#### Switzerland- Parliament reflects the will of the people

Take the example of Switzerland, which is considered as one of the best democracies in the world. If fifty thousand people signed a demand for change in legislation then the government has to put forth a bill in the parliament. But if one hundred thousand people send in a signed demand for change in the legislation then the government has to put forth a bill for amending the constitution. The people have direct control over the constitution and its process of creating the same.

But in our country if fifty thousand people send in a signed demand for any thing to the government, they probably will not even get an acknowledgement slip from the government that their demand is received.

There are many other examples that abound showing the direct control of people over the government and the establishment. But in our country the established system reduces the people as helpless spectators who have no control over the establishment.

There is a crying need, therefore, to bring in the change that empowers the people to exercise their fundamental right and be a free citizen in a democratic set up.

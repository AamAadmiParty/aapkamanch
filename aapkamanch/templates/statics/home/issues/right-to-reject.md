When we go to cast our vote, sometimes we do not want to vote for any candidate or party as we do not find them upto our expectation. Still we have no option but to vote for someone. Now there will be a last button in the voting machine opting for “No One”. If you do not like any candidate you can click this button. If this option gets a majority of votes, fresh elections will be conducted within a month. The parties and candidates rejected in the cancelled elections will forfeit their right to contest again in the re-elections.

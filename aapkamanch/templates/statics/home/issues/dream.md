# The Dream of Our Freedom Fighters

WE, THE PEOPLE OF INDIA, having solemnly resolved to constitute India into a SOVEREIGN SOCIALIST SECULAR DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC and to secure to all its citizens:
JUSTICE, social, economic and political;
LIBERTY, of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship;
EQUALITY of status and of opportunity; and to promote among them all
FRATERNITY assuring the dignity of the individual and the unity and integrity of the Nation;
IN OUR CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY this twenty-sixth day of November, 1949, DO HEREBY ADOPT, ENACT AND GIVE TO OURSELVES THIS CONSTITUTION.

This preamble depicts our dream, the dream of ordinary Indians.

This is a dream of democracy, social justice, secularism and of sovereign India. The preamble of the constitution promises a just society. It is a promise of Liberty, Equality and Brotherhood.

Even 65 years after Independence, India of today is totally contrary to what was imagined. Why? Because the framework designed to run the country was totally inappropriate. We wanted an independent India, but continued with the rules, regulations and laws from the British era. Before Independence, this framework was answerable to British rulers and not to public. After independence, it swore allegiance to indigenous leaders and stayed anti-public. Hence the tyranny of the rulers continued â€”first by the Britishers, and later by our own people.

Aam Aadmi Party wants to totally upturn the system. First of all the systemic structure carried forward from the British era has to be changed. The structure has to be loyal and accountable to the public and not to the leaders. Being accountable is not limited to changing of guard once in five years through voting. The elected Government should also be answerable directly to the public. The Public should have authority to remove corrupt and ineffective leaders and officers.

> This Dream of Golden India lies unfulfilled

# Aam Aadmi Party Deserves A Better Website

(And a Forum)

We are members of Aam Aadmi Party and we truly believe that this party presents us the best opportunity to bring accountability into the government and end large scale corruption.

The work done by Arvind Kejriwal and the other leaders is truly inspirational and we would love to contribute our bit.

### The Problem

Lets quickly have a look at the official AAP Website:

<img src="assets/aapkamanch/img/aap-current-site.png" class="img-responsive" style="box-shadow: 2px 2px 5px rgba(0,0,0,0.5); margin: 40px 0" />

1. There are 15 font faces on the home page, which conveys very poor aesthetics.
1. It conveys something very chaotic, careless and thoughtless, which we are not.
1. If we wish to run the government, we can make a better site.
1. There is hardly any focus on Swaraj or the core stand of AAP on any of the issues.
1. Most of the information is conveyed on Facebook or Twitter, platforms that are not owned by AAP.
1. A lot of good content is hidden away in PDF files, like the Vision and Party Consitution.

### The Solution

We realized that the best way to help AAP is to build a better site. And like AAP, present an alternative. So here is our alternative. Here is what we think we did better.

1. Clean, responsive and uncluttered layouts and CSS.
1. Focus on issues and [swaraj](/swaraj).
1. Better pages for [AAP leaders](/leaders).
1. Region based [forum](/india) for discussing [issues AAP is fighting for](/issues).

### There is Still A lot To Be Done

To make this website + forum, we built a new web application. It seems an overkill, but its Free and Open Source and its there for anyone to use. It belongs to the Party too!

> If the "Official" AAP team wants us to continue, we would love to do it.

### Whats Next

We did our bit, if you like what we did, tell Aam Aadmi Party Leaders to make this the official website of the Aam Aadmi Party.

Thanks!

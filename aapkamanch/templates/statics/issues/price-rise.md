> Public Participation in Determining the Prices of Main Commodities

Today inflation is making life hell for the common man. The Government has deliberately inflated the rates of many commodities just to ensure that corporate giants make more profit. This is direct corruption. The prices of the main commodities should not be fixed without public consent. This does not mean that public will fix the price of all things. Most items sold in the market are subject to demand and supply but the prices for essential items like diesel, petrol etc, for which the government determines the price should be determined with public consent.

1. The price of petrol, diesel, LPG and gas cylinders can be reduced immediately. On one hand, the government has provided relief to big, wealthy companies worth Rs 13 lakh crore in the last 3 years and on the other hand it is extracting Rs 2 lakh crore each year from the common man by taxing his diesel and petrol. Is this good governance? Tax relief for the wealthy and putting all the burden on common man should stop immediately. If a tax of Rs 13 lakh crore is collected from these companies and Rs 2 lakh crore taxes on common man are waived off, petrol can be priced at Rs 50 and diesel at Rs 40.
2. The reason gas is expensive in the country is because in 2000 the BJP government gave refining and extraction contracts of many natural gas wells to Reliance and other private companies. In 2004, Reliance entered into an agreement with the Government of India that for 17 years Reliance will provide this gas at the rate of 2 dollars per unit. But Reliance had no intention of doing so. In just two years, in 2006, this rate was increased to double the price of 4 dollars per unit by the then Congress led UPA government. Instead of confronting Reliance, Congress increased the price to 4 dollars. The new agreement was that Reliance will supply gas at this rate till 2014. However, this agreement was also broken. In 2010, Reliance again asked the government to increases the procurement price of gas from 4 dollars to 14 dollars per unit! At this point when the Union Oil and Gas Minister Mr. Jaipal Reddy refused to agree to this, the Congress Government replaced him with Mr.Veerappa Moily. It is now being speculated that after the 2014 general elections the price of gas could go up to 14 dollars per unit. This will make gas cylinders unaffordable for the common family. Today the Governmentisproviding6cylindersat Rs.400/cylinder,andmore than six will be available at Rs. 900/cylinder. If the procurement price is increased to 14 dollars from 4 dollars, then the six cylinders will cost 1400 and rest will cost 3000/cylinder. Both the BJP and the Congress are bending over backwards to accommodate the demands of Reliance. Aam Aadmi Party strongly opposes this. According to our information Reliance should get only Rs. 2.50/unit of gas. This would not only cover the cost but also include profit. With this price each person can get unlimited cylinders for only Rs. 350/cylinder.
3. Electricity and water rates are increased in Delhi in improper way. Rates of electricity are adjudicated by DERC- a government Commission. On 5th May 2010, DERC was going to take out an order to reduce the electricity rates by 23% instead of increasing it. When Chief Minister Ms. Sheila Dixit came to know of it, she stopped them. On 4th May 2010, Ms. Dikshit wrote a letter forbidding them to do so. Accordingly, the order that was to be passed on 5th May 2010 was stopped a day before it was to be passed. When Mr. Prashant Bhushan, a senior member of the Party and eminent lawyer came to know of this, he registered a case against the government in Delhi High Court. After a year of hearing, the court rapped Ms. Sheila Dikshit and asked DERC to pass a new order. In the meantime the Chairperson of the commission had retired. Ms. Sheila Dikshit had her own man in his place. He passed a order with substantial increase in the tariff. It is obvious that there is a nexus between Electricity companies and Ms. Sheila Dikshit. If Aam Aadmi Party comes to power, electricity tariffs will be reduced in Delhi.
4. In Delhi and other parts of India, current governments are planning to privatise water supply. This will result in making even water very expensive. Water is basic necessity and the natural right of everyone. Privatization of this is inhumane and unconstitutional.
5. If petrol, diesel, gas, electricity and water rates are reduced, other commodities will naturally become cheaper. A system will be put in place by which people's consent will be necessary for future pricing of such critical commodities.
6. The government has started dabbling in speculation and futures trading on all commodities. Rice, wheat, pulses, all commodities are being gambled upon, which is the genesis of price rise. This speculation must stop.

# The Three Pillars of Current Framework

### 1. The Executive

Today, all big and small decisions that affect the nation are taken by a few select members of Government including leaders and bureaucrats. The 'Aam Aadmi' has no say. The government and public are on opposite sides. Top leaders of some parties and some influential industrialists are jointly running the country. They are oppressing the people, indulging in corrupt practices and increasing inflation! The hapless public keeps begging without any success. It changes the ruling party every five years, but conditions remain the same.

Should not the public be the Government itself? Aam Aadmi Party wants to change the definition of the word "Government". There will be no kings, no subjects and no VIPs. There will be only the 'Aam Aadmi'. Every "Aam Aadmi" of this country will be the "Government".

Is this possible? Of course it is! Several countries of the world are doing this. We can learn from them and develop a new model suitable for India. This model will require that any policy needed by a village shall be made by the villagers themselves by taking decisions in the Gram Sabha. In the cities people of the locality will decide about their local problems and devise regulations to deal with them. Thus, these local people deciding on local issues will be the local "government". But these laws and regulations have to be within the larger framework of our Constitution and other laws that will take precedence in any dispute.

> Decisions required for a larger area affecting several villages and cities will be taken by the State Government.

> Decisions affecting the whole nation, national security and other such topics will be taken by the Central Government.

### 2. The Legislature

We elect our Members of Legislative Assemblies and Members of Parliament. They sit in the Vidhan Sabhas and the Parliament and make laws. The Public has no role in this law making exercise. All these Legislation are thrust on the hapless public. Some legislation is blatantly anti-public and biased in favour of certain people.

**Except in five countries, the public has a direct hand in making legislation in almost all other democracies. This is called Referendum and Direct Initiative. India is among these five unfortunate countries.**

Aam Aadmi Party wants the common man to participate directly in the legislative process at state or national level. It should have the power to change or abolish laws. This is called Referendum. Similarly it can force the Legislature or Parliament to pass a new law. This is Direct initiative. We want these two to start functioning in India.

### 3. The Judiciary

Today a common man needs lakhs of rupees to afford legal representation in either the Supreme Court or a High Court. Even in lower courts, lawyers charge thousands of rupees for each date. Only rich people can really afford to pay so much. Others find it almost impossible to go to courts. Then, is the judiciary only for the affluent? Since independence, has any poor person reached the Supreme Court? **Unless a lawyer offers to fight a case for free it is impossible for a poor or middle class person to go to a court. Should we get justice in this country as a matter of charity instead of as a right?**

Today we get decisions in courts instead of justice. Corruption in the judiciary is growing by day People now seriously believe that Justice is for sale in India. This is lethal for Indian democracy.

This has to change. Aam Aadmi Party wants that people should have justice as a right. Justice should be a fundamental right of a common man and he should not be made to beg in front of a lawyer. **Justice should be dispensed to the common man at his doorstep, his village, his locality. There should be no need for him to travel to Delhi.** The whole judicial system needs to be changed.

#### We Have to Change the Political System. Unite the Common People.

Politics is a sacred word. Politics is for serving the nation and society. Gandhiji was a politician. He believed that politics sans spirituality is dangerous for society and the nation. Today, politics means crime and corruption. Money from Power and Power by using Money is the foundation of modern politics.

This has to change. Politics has to connect again with social service and national pride. That will be the aim of Aam Aadmi Party.

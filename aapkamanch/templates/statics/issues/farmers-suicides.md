<p class="lead">Government policies are forcing the farmers to commit suicide. On one hand, because of expensive seeds and fertilizer, farming is becoming expensive. On the other hand the government fixes such low rates for the crop that even the input cost is not covered.</p>

For example, last year according to Haryana Government's figures, the cost of producing rice was Rs.1,560 per Quintal whereas Government kept the base purchase price at Rs.1,280 per Quintal. Similarly in Maharashtra, the cost of growing sugarcane was Rs. 3,000/ton, but the sugar mills were only offering Rs. 2,300/ton to the farmer. If the farmer does not even get his input price, he will be forced to commit suicide!

Governments are forcing villagers to move to cities. There is not enough to eat in the villages and the cities are getting overwhelmed by increased population and inflation.

> Aam Aadmi Party believes that farmers should get atleast enough to cover their input prices and make a decent profit.

According to the **Swamithathan Report**, farmers should get the sum of all their inputs plus a profit of 50%. Aam Aadmi Party entirely agrees with this. If we implement this, Haryana farmers would get Rs. 2,300 instead of Rs. 1,280 per quintal. Similarly sugarcane farmers of Maharashtra would get Rs. 4,500 instead of Rs. 2,300 per ton. This should be the basis for fixing the purchase price of crops in the whole country.

India still lives in its villages. Without the development and prosperity of the villages, India cannot be prosperous. To save the country we need to save the villages. Hence the resources of the country should be divided according to the population of villages or cities. Facilities in the villages should get better. If we implement the model of Swaraj, villagers will be able to design and execute developmental schemes themselves. Since they would be the stakeholders in the development, each village will get basic conveniences without running to the cities to improve the conditions of their village.

**The developmental schemes for the villages should be made in the villages and not in the state capitals or Delhi.** There should be gram sabhas in all villages and Government officials should be under Gram sabha. Natural Resources: Water, Forest, land and all natural resources should be under local custody. Natural resources of the country are national wealth. This should be used for the development of the population. It should not be used for private profit of individual companies.

The state of contractual labour across industries is alarming. Most of them are kept on contracts, which can be terminated at will. There is no leave or bonus . Even minimum wage/DC rate is not given. Contractors embezzles the EPF and ESI money of the laborers. Almost all labour laws are violated because Labour Commissioner takes bribes from the contractor and big companies and sells labour rights. This exploitation of labourers has to stop immediately. A new policy has to be formulated to secure basic comforts, justice and respectful life for an honest labourer.

India is a very big country. People have myriad complaints. We will go around the country and talk to the people. We will ask them their problems and possible solutions. We will also have debates and discussions on various matters and will find the solution through consensus. This is how our manifesto will be prepared.
Committees of experts are being instituted on about thirty issues. These committees of the Aam Aadmi Party will prepare their recommendations in three to four months time. The Aam Aadmi Party will decide on its stand after these have been debated all over the country and within the Party. Other parties decide on their policies behind closed doors, as if they know the solution to all the world's problems. Their decisions are based on their perception of vote bank politics. Their prime consideration is how many votes will we get if we announce such and such measure as our policy? They have sidelined the interest of the nation. Aam Aadmi Party will not do this. Decisions will be taken keeping the common person's view in mind.

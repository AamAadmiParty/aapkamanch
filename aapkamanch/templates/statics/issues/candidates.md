We have put this question to the people and received many suggestions. After considering these suggestions and discussing among ourselves, we have prepared the first draft of the process of selecting good candidates. Suggestions from everyone are welcome on the following:

1. The names of prospective candidates will be invited from the local area through appropriate publicity. Anyone can nominate any good person from his or her locality or nominate himself or herself. Through this process those good people will get an opportunity to stand for elections who are not able to do so at present because of shortage of funds.
2. All applicants will have to fill a form in which they will have to declare the details of all accusations levelled against them, criminal and other cases, cases of corruption, all sources of their income and their family's income, the total wealth of themselves and their family and all the work they have done for the community.
3. These forms can be deposited through the party's local offices or via the party website. These forms will be brought to the National office of the party for Parliamentary elections and to the party's State office for Assembly elections.
4. All the forms will be sent to the Assembly Committees or the Parliamentary Committee.
5. The committees will investigate all the information given in the form. An investigation report will be prepared for every form. They will meet and note their comments and recommendations for every applicant. All differing opinions will be recorded separately on the report.
6. Apart from other things, the Committee will definitely comment on the following:
	1. HowistheCandidateperceivedinthecommunity.
	1. Are the people of the area aware about the work done by the applicant? If yes, has it resulted into influence in the community? Is it good or bad?
	1. Are any cases of corruption or another crime pending in the courts against the applicant? If yes, then details of these cases will be noted in the report.
	1. Was the applicant ever accused of corruption or other crime? What is the impression of the people about these accusations? Do people think these to be correct or false?
	1. What is the source of the candidate's income? Do people have a negative impression about the sources of the candidate's income?
	1. Is the applicant drug addict and make a nuisance of himself or herself for his family or society?
	1. Have any questions been raised about the character of the applicant?
	1. Has the applicant ever participated in any communal activity? Does the applicant respect all religions? Has the applicant ever tried to spread hatred towards any religion or caste?
	1. Has the applicant ever taken part in any violence?
7. A Screening Committee will be constituted. For the Parliamentary elections, there will be people with national stature and some members of the National Committee. For Assembly elections, a similar committee will be formed at the state level.
8. The Screening Committee will go through all the reports on the applicants. Their objective will not be to nominate the candidates but to weed out undesirable applicants. If the Screening Committee wishes, it can also investigate any particular matter relating to any candidate.
9. The list of applicants after the removal of undesirable candidates by the Screening Committee will be prepared.
10. The names of all these candidates will be put on the party website and people will be invited to submit any evidence they may have against any candidate, either to the local office or via the party's website.
11. Evidence from the public will again be put up before the Screening Committee. If the Screening Committee finds the evidence correct against any applicant, they can remove the applicant from the list. A fresh list will be prepared after this exercise.
12. A convention of all short-listed applicants and the local workers will be held. In this convention, the Party workers will vote for the applicants on the basis of preferential voting and will select one candidate.
13. The nominated candidate will have to give the following undertaking under oath:

	If I win,
	1. I will not use a red light on my car.
	1. I will not take unnecessary security cover. The security forces should not be for the security of leaders but for the security of the common people. The leaders do not need any more security than the common man.
	1. I will not take a large government bungalow but will live in a small house like a common person.
	1. I am fully in agreement with the idea of self-governance, Swaraj. I believe that in a democracy, power should be directly with the people and not with the leaders and officers. I will do everything to get a law which makes this possible. Till this law is enacted I will do everything in consultation with the people of my constituency.
	1. I am committed to the Janlokpal bill and towards electoral reforms. I will do all I can to get laws enacted which will enable this.
	1. The government must not have the right to take over the land belonging to the people without their consent. I will do all I can to bring about a law which will prevent this.
	
This is the first effort at selecting good candidates. You are invited to give your views and suggestions on this process.

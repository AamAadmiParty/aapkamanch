<p class="lead">A significant portion of our society has been discriminated against as untouchables, and has suffered severe humiliation and injustice in the past.</p>
	
Even after sixty-five years of independence untouchability still exists in parts of our country. It is the responsibility of whole society to honor and love all brethren and march forward together.

The reservation system was introduced to resolve the issue of social inequality. We believe that at this point, reservation is essential for the advancement of the deprived and marginalized section of the society. At the same time it is essential that the benefits of reservation reach to those who are most needy even amongst this lot. Reservation should not be an option for those who have already benefited from it and are now financially prosperous. These should be for socially and economically weaker sections only.

Unfortunately until now all political outfits have used the issue of reservations to create vote banks for themselves. Vested political interests have ensured that the most marginalized sections of society remain marginalized and become the fodder for vote banks.

However, we have to reconsider and think if only reservations are enough to ensure progress among the backward segments of society? ***Reservation alone will not serve the purpose. Along with reservation, free higher education should be provided without the labels of religion, caste and creed.***

### Creation of a Just and Equal Society free of Prejudice and Oppression

Aam Aadmi Party's most important agenda will be to upgrade all government schools in the country to the standard of good private schools. This will improve the future of children from both socially and economically backward sections. We do not believe that everything is perfect in private schools, but they have their good points which would be incorporated in government schools.

However, even this will be not enough. We have to make an effort to remove this venomous tendency of untouchability from people's minds. We have to campaign to create a civil environment which fosters amity and harmony between different castes.

**In a nutshell there should be an efficient system to stop caste humiliation and violence.** There should be enough platforms to deliver the benefits of reservations to the most marginalized backward classes, minorities, tribals and other weakest sections of society. To make sure that the benefits of reservation reach really deserving people, priorities should be given to those people, families and groups who have not yet received any benefits, instead of those who are already prosperous. Most backwards, dalits, tribals and nomads need special schemes.

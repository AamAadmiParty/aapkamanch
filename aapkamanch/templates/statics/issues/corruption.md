# Corruption

There will be a stringent legislation against corruption called Jan Lokpal. This will allow the public to directly file the complaints against the corrupt leaders and officers and get justice.

- Now-a-days the cases of corruption keep continuing for years without any resolution. All this while, the corrupt leaders keeps getting elected and plundering the country. Sometimes the cases are not resolved even till the death of the concerned person! Janlokpal legislation will ensure that investigation and litigation would be expedited. This will secure the conviction of a guilty person within two years, his assets would be confiscated and he would be expelled from his position. Cases against leaders will be promptly investigated and corrupt leaders will be jailed within six months.
- If Aam Aadmi Party comes to power, fast track courts will be constituted and CBI will be made an independent entity. Guilty people from all scams will be jailed within six months. All property of such people will be confiscated and deposited into Government coffers.
- A common man has to pay bribe to get work done in more or less all the government offices. Janlokpal legislation will determine the time frame and specific officers for different kind of work. If the work does not get done by that officer in the allotted time, there will be a penalty and that would be deducted from his salary and paid to the complainant.

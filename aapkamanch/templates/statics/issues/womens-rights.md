<p class="lead">An effective system must be installed to prevent abortion of female fetuses as also to end the exploitation and murder of women.</p>

Girls in villages should have special facilities for education. No liquor shops should be permitted to be opened in any locality without the consent of women in that locality. One third of the seats in the Parliament and Assemblies should be reserved for women.

#### Safety and security of women

Safety of women has become a critical issue after the recent gang rape incident in Delhi. Women are afraid to come out of their homes. Our legal system is responsible for this. **On one hand, the law does not provide for sufficient punishment for crimes like eve-teasing, rape etc and on the other hand, legal process in our courts takes almost 10-15 years to bring the culprits to book.** During this period, the rapists keep roam free and keep intimidating and mentally harassing the victims. 

**In contrast, in 2005, a German girl was raped in Jaipur and a fast track court had punished the culprit and sent him to jail in 16 days.** If a fast track court in Jaipur can punish a rapist in 16 days, why can't our country's courts decide on cases of rape within two months? Strangely, instead of making fast track courts like Jaipur all over the country, the UPA government even closed the Jaipur fast track court citing paucity of funds. 

Currently, all over India, over one hundred and twenty five thousand cases are pending in our courts since many years. Till these cases are decided and the culprits are handed out severe punishment, women will continue to get raped. 

Because of this, Aam Aadmi Party believes that the following three steps are needed:

- The law should provide that **crimes like molestation and rape should be resolved in the quickest possible time and the culprits punished within two months.**
- As many investigation officers and fast track courts should be provided as required to punish the culprits within two months.
- The law should be amended wherever it does not provide for adequate punishments for crimes against women.

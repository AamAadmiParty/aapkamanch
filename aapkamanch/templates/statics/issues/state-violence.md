We saw police atrocities after the gangrape incident in Delhi. If a common man goes to file a complaint against the Police, the Police often take bribes from the perpetrators and downplay the matter. It also tries to trouble the accuser in various ways. **Fake cases are often filed against innocent people.**

Police atrocities were experienced during this incident also. Police lathi-charged the demonstrators and used tear gas on them. This happens because the Police works directly under the control of corrupt politicians and political parties. Aam Aadmi Party believes that the local Police should be directly accountable to the local people instead of politicians.

The Mohalla Sabha should have authority to summon local police officials. It must be compulsory for the Police to register a case if the local Mohalla Sabha so desires. If there are repeated complaints against any Police official, the local Mohalla Sabha should have the power to penalize him or terminate his services. If Aam Aadmi Party come to power, the Police will be directly accountable to the local people.
